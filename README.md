Descriptive Code
================

This project consists of some individual code examples, which attempt to test
the principle of "Descriptive Code" - the idea that source code can be made more
readable simply by choosing each identifier in the code, i.e. class, method or variable
name, to be as accurate as possible as a description of whatever it actually represents.

In line with this purpose, comments in the code are kept to a bare minimum (even though
some level of commenting is always desirable in real code).
