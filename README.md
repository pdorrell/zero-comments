Descriptive Code
================

This project consists of some individual code examples, which attempt to test
the principle of "Descriptive Code" - the idea that source code can be made more
readable simply by choosing each identifier in the code, i.e. class, method or variable
name, to be as accurate as possible as a description of whatever it actually represents.

In line with this purpose, comments in the code are kept to a bare minimum, even though
some level of commenting is always desirable in real code.

Code Notes
----------

In practice, everyone comes to code with a different level of knowledge about whatever the
code is for.

In an attempt to see how far one can go *without* putting any comments in the code, I
have put *all* additional code documentation and explanation in the accompanying README.
(The only exception is that where it is appropriate to give credit for other related code in the code
itself, I have done so.)

So, if you think that you already know everything about the subject of the code, you can go
straight into the code and see how easily you can understand it.

But if you get stuck, read the accompanying README file, and then go back into the code.
